  "bio": "TK the Architect is a musical project by artist/producer/engineer Zach TK Zanghi.  Raised in New York by a Japanese Mother and an Italian-American father, TK spent much of his early life on the fringes of two different cultures.  Identity was, and still is, an ongoing conversation.  \n\nTK’s past works show his multifaceted talents, including production and writing credits across multiple full-length albums and singles, as well as personal artistic endeavors.  \n",

      "releaseDescription": "The cold feeling of isolation and the introspection that comes with it. ‘too many’ finds TK the Architect reflecting on the connection we have, not only with others and the greater world, but with ourselves. Through death, time, and failures in communication, people come and go. But the indelible marks they leave are up to us to reconcile.\n",
