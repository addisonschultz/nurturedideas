  "bio": "CAMPTACONIC is the genre-bending creative brainchild of artists Aire Atlantica, Zuli, BlackJeans, TK The Architect, which spawned from a five day trip to upstate New York in January 2019. Although the group members have previously worked together on independent collaborations, the goal of their trips are to write, produce, and engineer an album in seclusion with no strings attached. \n",
