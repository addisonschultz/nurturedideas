  "bio": "Stefan Mahendra is a South East London bred musician that has established himself as an anomaly amongst the modern-day R&B artist. His love of Soul, R&B, and Motown set the tone for what his career is today. With a polished and refined craft that he has made his own, he continues to push the boundary of his original music. He has a diverse palette of influences including D'Angelo, Marvin Gaye, Donny Hathaway, Stevie Wonder, John Legend. \n\nStefan has toured the world with bands that were opening shows for the likes of world-famous artists such as Sting, Shaggy, Melanie C, and many more. His debut television appearance was made in 2019, when he became a quarter-finalist on The Voice UK 2019. Following his time on The Voice, Stefan and his band BrownSugar went on to support Olly Murs at the O2 Arena London. \n\nWhen Stefan is not creating and recording his original music, he continues to perform all over the world, leaving you with a desire for more of that classic old school sound with a modern twist that appeals to all ages.\n",
