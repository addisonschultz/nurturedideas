  "bio": "Sitting in your pocket, on your screen, and in your home, one monolithic brand listens in, makes “suggestions,” and subconsciously informs the world around you. It lies in the background only to entirely shape the foreground. Sound familiar? \n\nWe needn’t cite any real-life names as we know they’re probably listening, but this idea remains the crux of Zuli Jr.’s Stop It God., due May ’21. In his case, Daisy serves as the ever-present corporate overlord with a HAL 9000-style computer to navigate daily life. Crafting a story of his own, the New York singer, songwriter, and alternative R&B insurgent opens up a worm hole between future-facing pop, Platonic allegory, science fiction, and eerily parallel truths. \n",
