  "releaseDescription": "'Wake Up' features Momeni’s own vocals for the first time, with his lyrics urging listeners to think independently, free of influence from the media and it’s never-ending feed of content.\n\nThe song was written while Nick was in Tokyo. It's written to encourage people to question their reality and what they're sold as the truth. Look up from your phone. Log off Instagram, turn off the news, or at least change the channel."
