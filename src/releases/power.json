  "releaseDescription": "Fuelled by the limited media coverage surrounding protests in Iran and amplified by the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, 'Power' is for anyone who has to take to the streets. \n\nThe club edit serves as an ode to Nick’s coming of age among the city’s underground scene, reimagining the track for a nocturnal setting."
