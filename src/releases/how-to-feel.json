"releaseDescription": "The first single from Zuli Jr.'s sophomore album - 'Stop it God.'. Sunny production and a steady beat strut underneath his dynamic vocal performance, fluttering from intimate verses into fiery falsetto.\n\n\"How to Feel is about examining the ego from the outside looking in and how that affects the people around you. This is easily one of my favorite songs on the record and feels like the perfect transition from one chapter to the next.‚Äù - Zuli",
